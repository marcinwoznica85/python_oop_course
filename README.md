# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Python

 ### Objective
 Provide a theoretical and practical introduction to OOP in Python for programmers that are new to Object Oriented landscape and for those that wish to understand it better.

 ### Requirements
 - Basic knowledge of Python - syntax, keywords, built-in data types, creating variables, writing and invoking simple functions, using Python console, executing Python script
 - Installed Python 3.10+ and IDE eg. VS Code, PyCharm
 - Office presence
 - (optional) IDE that allows reading *.ipynb files (Jupyter Notbooks)
 

 ### Agenda
 1. Introduction
    - prior knowledge
    - terminology
    - class definition syntax
    - operations on classes
    - object / instance
    
 1. Pillars of Object Oriented Programming
    - Encapsulation
        - class / instance attributes
        - bound / class / static methods
        - class initialization
        - information hiding
    - Inheritance
        - inheritance and relationships
        - multiple inheritance (MRO)
        - mixin
        - composition
    - Abstraction
        - abstract classes
        - abstract methods
        - abstract property
    - Polymorphism
        - method overriding (super)
        - method overloading (dispatch)
        - callable
        - iteratable
        - subscriptable

 1. Design considerations
    - Cohesion
    - Coupling
